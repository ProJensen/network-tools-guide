# Tool: `tracert`

## üîß Purpose
The tracert command is used to identify the route and measure the delay of packets across a network. It helps you determine where a connection fails or slows down when communicating with another device or website.

## ‚úÖ Use Cases:
- Identify slow or unreachable network segments

- Locate where a network connection is dropping

- Understand the path between your device and an external server

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Tracing your Destination

```bash
tracert google.com
```

This command traces the path from your computer to your destination, showing all routers (hops) along the way. If a specific hop takes too long or times out, it may indicate a network issue.
