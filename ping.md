# Tool: `ping`

## 🔧 Purpose
The `ping` command is used to test the reachability of a host (domain name or IP address) on an IP network. It helps determine if the host is online and how long it takes for packets to travel.

## Example 1: Ping a domain

```bash
ping google.com
```
## Example 2: Ping a DNS server

```bash
ping 8.8.8.8
```
